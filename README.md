Reminiscens Lifecontext API
===========

Lifecontext is a set of crawlers for creating a knowledge base of historical media and metadata from public web resources 
including also a simple RESTful API to access this knowledge base asking for resources that are related to a location and 
a period of time. It serves as the gateway to resources used by Reminiscence applications for bulding context around 
life stories.
